  % Introduction
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{block}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MRI is a safe and powerful tool that can be used to
  image both anatomy and function. 
  \item Acquiring 3D MRI over time has several clinical applications:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Reduce image blur from conventional 3D acquisition.
    \item Visualize signal behavior over time.
    \item Quantify tissue parameters in anatomy.
    \end{itemize}
  \item We aim to find a robust and low-dimensional representation of 
  the dynamic images.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  % Motivation
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{block}{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The image's Fourier transform (called k-space) is sampled over time. 
  \item The samples are grouped into time-consistent k-space bins.
  \imgnobox{acq_over_time.png}{0.9}\n
  \item \underline{Goal:} Clinically feasible scan times by reducing dimensionality with low model error.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  % Background
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
  \begin{block}{Background}
  Signal evolution of pixel intensity over time parametrized by tissue
  $T_2$ relaxation.
  \imgnobox{pix_time.png}{0.91}
  Signals evolutions are correlated $\implies$ data captured by a low-dimensional
  subspace.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Estimate $T_2$ distribution from tissue in anatomy of interest.
  \item Simulate curves with $T_2$ values drawn from distribution.
  \item Form matrix $X$ with signals as columns arranged in increasing order of $\ell_2$ norm.
  \end{enumerate}

  % Methods

  \begin{block}{Methods and Results}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\underline{Principal Component Analysis:}}
  Project $X$ onto first 3 principal components, $U$. This solves:
  $$\underset{U, A}{\text{min}} \quad ||X - UA||_F^2$$ 
  Estimated matrix $X' = UA$. Normalized model error of $X_i'$:
  \imgnobox{bad_svd.png}{0.5} 
  \item {\underline{Multilayer Linear Regressor:}}
  Inspired by Neural Networks, this only uses linear transformations.
  \imgnobox{neural_network.png}{0.6}
  \begin{align*}
  U &\leftarrow \theta_2 \\ A &\leftarrow \theta_1 X
  \end{align*}
  This framework is used to solve:
    $$\underset{U, A}{\text{min}} \quad \underset{i}{\text{max}} \quad ||X_i - Ua_i||_2^2$$

  \begin{block}{Discussion and Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Our flexible framework enables the evaluation of different cost functions.
  \item We produce a low-dimensional representation
  with lower maximal error at a small cost of global error.
